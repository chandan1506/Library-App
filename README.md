# Library App

This is a small Library app built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. It provides a set of APIs secured by JWT authentication and protected by roles. Users with different roles can create and view books based on their permissions.

## Features

- User registration and login
- Role-based access control
- Create books (role: CREATOR)
- View books created by the user (role: VIEWER)
- View all books (role: VIEW_ALL)
- Filter books by creation time

## Database Connection
The application uses MongoDB as the database. The connection to the database is established in the config/db.ts file. Make sure to provide the correct MongoDB connection URL in the .env file.

# Additional Notes

* The application uses the bcrypt library for password hashing and the jsonwebtoken library for JWT token generation.
* The API follows RESTful principles and returns JSON responses.
* Error handling is implemented for various scenarios, including validation errors and server errors.
